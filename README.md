# DBA Functions and Tools
The aim of this project is to collate useful SQL functions and tools that can be dropped onto a server and provide immediate benefit.

The tools that are to be collated should be
   > Business agnostic - have some use regardless of business processes
   > 
   
Any tools developed should include
   > comments that describe each step
   > descriptions of uncommon functions and stored procedures
   > work within a 2008 r2 + environment
     > any functions that are limited to a future/legacy version of SQL Server should be labelled clearly

Validation should be done of all code intially this will be done by submission to [Codereview.Stackexchange](http://codereview.stackexchange.com/)
